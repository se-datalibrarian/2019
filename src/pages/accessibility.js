    <h1>Southeast Data Librarian Symposium Planning Committee Commitment to Accessibility</h1>
    <p>The Southeast Data Librarian Symposium planning committee is an intentional ally of accessibility. We are committed to providing a learning environment rooted in openness, inclusion, and opportunity. The following are ways in which we honor our commitment:</p>

    <h2>Location and Environment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This conference is fragrance-free. Exposure to perfumes and other scented products (such as lotions, essential oils, and fabric softener) can trigger health reactions in people who have asthma, allergies, migraines, or chemical sensitivities. Please do not wear perfumes or other scented products so that chemically injured members of our community can attend.</li> 
      <li>Gender Neutral/All Gendered bathrooms will be available and accessible</li>
      <li>Lactation room will be available and accessible</li>
      <li>A quiet room will be available</li>
      <li>A map with accessible entrances and routes of the conference venue will be provided (forthcoming)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Lactation/Family Rooms</h3>
    <p>
      There are several lactation/family rooms on the Uptown Campus. The most convenient during the symposium is located on the 2nd floor of the LBC in a private, women's single stall bathroom. The room is labeled "Lactation Station" and is equipped with a sink, chair and table with literature. Like the LBC, this room is available 24 hours a day and no key is needed to use the room but it will lock from the inside.
    </p>
    <h3>Gender-Neutral Restrooms</h3>
    <p>The LBC has 7 single-stall, gender neutral restrooms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> 2 on the garden level located next to Suite G03</li>
      <li> 3 on the first level across from the Campus Services Customer Engagement Center</li>
      <li> 2 on the second level across from the Qatar Ballroom</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Presenters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Presenters should provide 5 access copies (print copies) of your presentations for audience members. Some should be in at least 12 pt font and the remaining at least 16 pt font</li> 
      <li>If you use images in your presentation and/or handouts, please provide a brief verbal and text description of what the image contains, alongside the context and intention of the images</li>
      <li>When choosing the slide and text colors of your presentation, please choose high contrast colors (e.g. black text on white background) for best visibility</li>
      <li>During your presentation, please repeat names and questions during Q&A using the microphone</li>
    </ul>
